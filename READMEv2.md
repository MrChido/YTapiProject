5/29/2018 3.24p Started with the interface, then found some documentation and inserted it into the
js file, did some varable rewrites and hopefuly i will get something moving soon.

5/30/2018 12.23p js file pulls data now. yay! Now to figure out how to display what the JS file produces. First idea is to do a basic href text link to the youtube video pages.
eventauly will move onto the thumbnails. maybe.
5/30/2018 1.27p Added a display feature for results, that will eventualy list the Results
found from the data pull. As of right now, the base url is inserted.

5/31/2018 11.01a With the help of my instructor again (dont be suprised im new to this level of programing ;) ) We got some links running, and I replicated the code for the other generated links.
At one point i will get around to eliminating the dry programing, but for now this is sufficent.
1.48p imagery was added, the images are not hyperlinks but at least i have links.
